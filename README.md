# Simulation
These are a set of Python codes for the numerical simulation of a four set of ODEs. After the codes are run, 
you will find plots of susceptible, recovered, infected individuals and the Vibrio Cholerae concentration against time. 
These plots are for both states that is the disease free and endemic steady states.
